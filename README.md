This is a complete tic tac toe implementation, complete with computer player written entirely in typescript types.

## To do

- It doesn't play perfectly right now (there's four forking plays that can beat it)
- Could do with better error messaging on invalid moves
- Currently causes TS Language server to crash occasionally in VSCode and every single time in [TS Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) ðŸ˜‚
